In this repo I'll learn about nodeJS by creating simple to - do app API, you can use this api freely and check the documentation here :

*note : I think in v1 version you cannot use this API because I only using one database stored in mongoDB atlus, so if two people using this API together their data will be mixed. But in the next update I will try to build this API with authentication so the data won't be mixed.
